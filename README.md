#  CHIP8EMU

A simple **CHIP-8** emulator made for the purpose of studying computer organization, mainly how emulation does work.

It was written in just a few days and code isn't really that great, it needs a lot of changes. I'll update it over time.

Feel free to clone this repository for the purpose of studying the code.

## Missing features

- Audio

## How to install

The only build requirements are **SDL** and **NCurses** libraries. To build for Unix-like systems, simply run `cd src/ && make && ./main rom_file` on the terminal. It wasn't tested on Windows.

#  CHIP8EMU

A simple **CHIP-8** emulator made for the purpose of studying computer organization, mainly how emulation does work.

It was written in just a few days and code isn't really that great, it needs a lot of changes. I'll update it over time.

Feel free to clone this repository for the purpose of studying the code.
